  Designed by Chicago architect Dirk Denison, the house is tucked into a misty
  canopy of cypress trees overlooking a dazzling white-sand beach. It's a
  quintessentially Carmel spot: a very narrow, slightly hilly lot with views of
  the ocean off Pebble beach, Carmel Point, and Point Lobos (the good news); and
  neighboring houses immediately to either side, not to mention the potential
  presence of thousands of curious tourists (the bad).
